# YellowBlockChallenge
A code sample for the 2019 Botball competition that completes the yellow block tower mission.
This particular code goes forward until it senses the line in the range in which you need to put the blocks, then puts them 
in that space, one by one. All servos and sensors are defined and can be changed as needed, but note that it will only work 
with what we tested.
